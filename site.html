<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p>The above text was written using a 'strong' style, which is HTML speak for bolding!</p>
<p>My name is <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;">Kayode Lambkin,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and I just used a 'text-decoration' and 'underline' style for my name so that it stands out <img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tiny4_9_11/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-cool.gif" alt="cool" /></span></p>
<p>That just there was an image, who's source was actually directly from this editor!</p>

<p>^ Here was an image I inserted from Google, which contains popular movies that I like!</p>
<p>Well, that's all I have for now, till next time!</p>
<p>(By the way, I wrote all this text in paragraph format, but you can use different text like a&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>as shown above)</p>
